It takes an infix expression from the user in a GUI and translates it to postfix. It then creates a tree and traverses the tree to determine the value of the user's expression. It finally regenerates the infix expression by traversing the tree recursively. Made for a class project.\r\n\r\n##Screenshot\r\n![alt text](https://github.com/lillyfwang/binomial-calculator/blob/master/Screenshot.png)\r\n\r\n##Running the Program\r\nTo compile the program, run line:\r\n`javac *.java`\r\n\r\nTo run the program, run line (opens up a GUI):\r\n`java Window`","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
