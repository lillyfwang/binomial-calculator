HOW TO START THIS PROJECT
-------------------------
.::Problem 1::.
Program acts as an Expression Tree Calculator by performing operations
on a postfix string. It takes an infix expression from the user in a GUI
and translates it to postfix. It then creates a tree and traverses the
tree to determine the value of the user's expression. It finally
regenerates the infix expression by traversing the tree recursively.

To compile the program, run line:
javac *.java

To run the program, run line:
